# Titanic-Machine-Learning-Competition
I participated in the Titanic ML competition where I used Machine learning to create a model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
Logistic Regression was my model of choice because it works well with probability with the help of its sigmoid function.
Pipelines and ColumnTransformers were used to simplify the coding process.
I performed well with a score of 0.75837
