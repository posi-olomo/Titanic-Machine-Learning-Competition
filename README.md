# Titanic-Machine-Learning-Competition
I participated in the Titanic ML competition where I used Machine learning to create a model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
Random Forest Classifier was my model of choice.
I applied Feature Engineering to create new features to better the model used.
I performed well with a score of 0.77751
